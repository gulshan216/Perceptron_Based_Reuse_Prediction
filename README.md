# Perceptron_Based_Reuse_Prediction
The last level caches(LLC) with just the LRU replacement policy are quite ineffective due to dead blocks existing in the cache for a long time before they finally get evicted. A good replacement policy plays an important role in providing high performance for memory intensive programs.

This project aims at implementation of perceptron learning with reuse prediction. The main idea is to do reuse prediction using perceptron learning to detect whether a block is likely to be reused, providing the ability to perform improved placement, replacement and bypass in the LLC.
